# Updated OAuth2 Setup with Google Identity Services

## What Changed

Google has deprecated the old OAuth2 libraries and now requires the new **Google Identity Services (GIS)** library. The code has been updated to use the modern authentication method.

## Step 1: Verify OAuth2 Client ID

Your existing OAuth2 Client ID should still work. Make sure it's configured in `config.js`:
```javascript
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: '379038705771-jp7a5rku7osaoge3guk56bf7nc9l3ou9.apps.googleusercontent.com',
```

## Step 2: Update OAuth2 Client Settings (if needed)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
3. Click on your OAuth2 Client ID
4. Make sure these settings are correct:
   - **Application type**: Web application
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**: 
     - `http://localhost` (for testing)
     - `https://yourdomain.com` (for production)
   - **Authorized redirect URIs**: (can be empty for this use case)

## Step 3: Enable Required APIs

Make sure these APIs are enabled:
1. **Google Sheets API**
2. **Google Drive API**

## Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Open your website
2. Fill out the form and submit
3. You should see a Google OAuth popup (new style)
4. Grant permission to access Google Sheets
5. The form data should be added to your sheet

## How the New Authentication Works

1. **Form submitted** → New Google Identity Services authentication starts
2. **Modern OAuth popup** → User grants permission (new Google UI)
3. **Access token received** → Used to authenticate API calls
4. **Data appended** → Form data added to Google Sheet

## Key Differences from Old Method

- ✅ Uses `google.accounts.oauth2.initTokenClient()` instead of deprecated `gapi.auth2`
- ✅ Uses `https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client` script instead of `https://apis.google.com/js/api.js`
- ✅ More secure and modern authentication flow
- ✅ Better user experience with updated Google UI

## Troubleshooting

### "Google Identity Services not loaded" Error
- Make sure the new script is included: `<script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client"></script>`
- Check browser console for any script loading errors

### "Invalid client ID" Error
- Verify your Client ID is correct in `config.js`
- Check that the domain is added to "Authorized JavaScript origins"

### OAuth Popup Issues
- Some browsers block popups by default
- Users may need to allow popups for your site
- Try testing in an incognito/private window

### Testing the New Authentication

Run this in the browser console to test:
```javascript
debugGoogleSheetsAPI();
```

This will test:
1. ✅ Google Identity Services loading
2. ✅ Authentication flow
3. ✅ API connection
4. ✅ Sheet access

## Migration Benefits

- **Future-proof**: Uses Google's latest authentication standards
- **More secure**: Enhanced security features
- **Better UX**: Modern Google authentication UI
- **Compliant**: Meets Google's current requirements

The new implementation should resolve the deprecation warning and provide a smoother authentication experience!
